## Executive Summary

### Business Context
The Work Order Forecasting Algorithm is a predictive analytics solution that enables CBRE to forecast future work order volumes at the building level using cross-client machine learning models. **The algorithm is designed to provide accurate predictions immediately, requiring only basic building characteristics to generate initial forecasts.** By leveraging historical data across multiple client sectors and incorporating environmental factors, this algorithm provides accurate predictions for capacity planning and budget forecasting up to 3+ months in advance. As additional operational data becomes available, the system continuously improves accuracy. The solution uses IFM Service Classification standards to provide consistent service categorization across all client portfolios.

### Strategic Alignment
This solution directly supports CBRE's strategic objectives by providing **data-driven workload forecasting** that enables proactive capacity planning and resource allocation. The cross-client training approach leverages CBRE's extensive portfolio data to create robust predictive models that deliver accurate forecasts even for buildings with limited historical data.

### Value Proposition
- **Immediate Forecasting**: Generate accurate predictions from Day 1 using only building characteristics and cross-portfolio intelligence
- **Predictive Capacity Planning**: 3-month advance visibility into work order volumes for optimal staffing
- **Budget Accuracy**: 25% improvement in operational budget variance through predictive analytics
- **Cross-Client Intelligence**: Leverage portfolio-wide data patterns for enhanced prediction accuracy, even for new buildings
- **Risk Mitigation**: Confidence intervals enable proactive planning for demand uncertainty
- **Service Classification Intelligence**: IFM-aligned service categorization for standardized cross-client reporting and analysis
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Continuous accuracy improvement as operational data accumulates
