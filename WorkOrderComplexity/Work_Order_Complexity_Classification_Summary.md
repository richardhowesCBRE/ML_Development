## How the Algorithm Works (5-Minute Overview for SMEs)

### What is "Complexity" in Facilities Management?

**Complexity Definition**: Work order complexity measures the total difficulty of completing a maintenance task, combining technical skill requirements, safety considerations, access challenges, and business impact factors. It directly correlates to the level of expertise needed, time required, and resources consumed.

#### **Real-World Complexity Factors**
- **Technical Expertise**: Does the work require specialized knowledge, certifications, or advanced troubleshooting skills?
- **Safety & Access**: Are there height restrictions, confined spaces, hazardous materials, or specialized safety protocols?
- **Business Impact**: Will the work disrupt operations, require coordination, or affect critical systems?
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Are there industry-specific compliance, documentation, or approval requirements?

#### **How Complexity Relates to Data Patterns**
Our algorithm identifies complexity through measurable data indicators:
- **High Labor Hours**: Complex work consistently takes longer to complete
- **Specialist Assignment**: Historical data shows certain work always requires expert-level technicians
- **Multiple Visits**: Complex work often needs callbacks or additional specialist support
- **Higher Costs**: Material, travel, and coordination costs increase with complexity
- **Sector Patterns**: Healthcare, life sciences, and data centers consistently show higher complexity scores

#### **Real-World Validation**
- **Low Complexity (0-33)**: Routine tasks apprentices complete successfully in predicted timeframes
- **Medium Complexity (34-66)**: Work requiring generalist skills with occasional specialist consultation
