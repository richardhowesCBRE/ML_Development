### **Most Important Business Problem: Suboptimal Identification and Prioritization of Self-Performance Opportunities**

**Problem Statement:** CBRE currently lacks a comprehensive, dynamic, and data-driven system to consistently identify, evaluate, and prioritize the most lucrative self-performance opportunities across diverse client portfolios and service scopes. This leads to missed cost-saving potentials, inefficient allocation of internal resources, and continued reliance on higher-cost third-party vendors for work that could be self-delivered, thereby impacting client value and account profitability.

**Why this is the most important:** The entire premise of the "Technical Self Delivery Playbook" and "Self-Delivery Toolkit" is about transitioning services from third-party vendors to in-house self-performance. If CBRE cannot accurately and efficiently identify *which* services to self-perform, *where*, and *when*, then all subsequent optimization efforts (staffing, processes, tracking ROI) are built on a potentially flawed or sub-optimal foundation. This problem directly addresses the core objective of "finding self performance opportunities."

---

### **5 Different ML Models to Solve This Problem:**

To address the "Suboptimal Identification and Prioritization of Self-Performance Opportunities" problem, these ML models would primarily leverage historical work order data (type, cost, vendor, duration, complexity, location), technician skill data, market rates for external services, SLA data, and client contract details.

1.  **Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) for Classification**
    *   **How it solves the problem:** This model would classify potential work orders or service categories as either "High Potential for Self-Performance" or "Low Potential for Self-Performance." It learns from historical data where self-performance was successful (e.g., lower cost, better SLA, higher client satisfaction) versus where it wasn't, or where 3rd-party delivery was significantly more expensive.
    *   **Data Leveraged:** Features would include work order type, average 3rd-party cost for that type, internal technician availability/skill match, historical self-perform success rates, geographical density of work, required tools/equipment, and estimated training costs.
    *   **Output/Insight:** A probability score (e.g., 0-1) indicating the likelihood that a given service/work order type at a specific location is a good candidate for self-performance. It can also provide feature importance, showing *why* certain factors make an opportunity more or less attractive (e.g., "high 3rd party cost" or "simple task requiring common skills").

2.  **Regression Models (e.g., Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression)**
    *   **How it solves the problem:** Once an opportunity is identified as a potential self-perform candidate, this model would predict the *quantifiable benefits*, specifically the estimated cost savings or ROI if that service were to be self-delivered. This moves beyond just "is it a good idea?" to "how much value will it create?".
    *   **Data Leveraged:** Historical 3rd-party costs for similar work, internal labor rates, material costs, estimated travel time, potential productivity gains, and any associated transition costs (e.g., training, new equipment).
    *   **Output/Insight:** A precise numerical prediction of the cost savings (or increased profitability) per work order or per service category, allowing for a clear financial prioritization of opportunities.

3.  **Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)**
    *   **How it solves the problem:** This model would group similar self-performance opportunities or sites together based on their characteristics (e.g., type of services, volume, location, complexity, current 3rd party spend patterns). This helps in developing standardized playbooks or identifying "clusters" of properties that are ripe for similar self-performance initiatives, making strategic planning more efficient.
    *   **Data Leveraged:** Work order attributes, property characteristics (size, type, age), geographical coordinates, historical spend data, and current staffing levels.
    *   **Output/Insight:** Identification of natural groupings or segments of self-performance opportunities. For example, "Cluster A" might represent small, remote sites ideal for multi-skilled generalists, while "Cluster B" might be large, complex facilities requiring specialized on-site teams. This enables targeted strategy development.

4.  **Anomaly Detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)**
    *   **How it solves the problem:** This model would identify "anomalies" in existing 3rd-party spend or work order patterns that might indicate overlooked self-performance opportunities. For example, a particular work order type that is consistently outsourced at a significantly higher cost than the market average, or a task that is simple but frequently handled by external vendors. These anomalies are prime targets for investigation.
    *   **Data Leveraged:** Historical 3rd-party invoices, work order descriptions, vendor performance data, and internal cost benchmarks.
    *   **Output/Insight:** Flags or alerts on specific work orders, vendors, or service types that stand out as unusual or inefficiently managed, highlighting areas where self-performance could yield significant, immediate benefits.

5.  **Recommender Systems (Content-Based or Hybrid)**
    *   **How it solves the problem:** Similar to how streaming services recommend movies, this system would recommend the "best next" self-performance opportunities for a given client account or region. It would consider the unique profile of an account (e.g., building types, current self-perform capabilities, historical pain points) and recommend specific services to transition based on successful past transitions in similar contexts.
    *   **Data Leveraged:** Client account profiles, historical self-perform project successes/failures, available internal technician skill sets, geographical data, and market intelligence on service costs.
    *   **Output/Insight:** A ranked list of specific services or work order categories that are most suitable for self-performance for a particular client or portfolio, along with a rationale or estimated impact. This provides actionable, tailored recommendations for the FM team.

Based on the provided documents and the core objective of "finding self-performance opportunities and ways to optimize staffing," here's a ranking of the identified problems from most valuable to least valuable for the business:

---

### **Ranking of Business Problems (Most Valuable to Least Valuable):**

**1. Suboptimal Identification and Prioritization of Self-Performance Opportunities**
*   **Why it's #1 (Most Valuable):** This is the **gateway problem**. The entire "Implementation Playbook_Technical Self Delivery" and "Self-Delivery Toolkit" are dedicated to this topic. If CBRE cannot effectively and systematically identify *which* services to self-perform, *where*, and *when*, then all other optimization efforts (staffing, processes, ROI tracking) are either misdirected or operating on a sub-optimal foundation. This problem directly addresses the "finding self-performance opportunities" aspect of your request and is the primary driver of value creation through self-delivery. Without solving this, the potential cost savings and control benefits of self-performance remain largely untapped.

**2. Inefficient Workforce Allocation, Skill Utilization, and Talent Development**
*   **Why it's #2:** This problem is the **enabler of self-performance execution**. Once opportunities are identified (Problem #1 solved), the ability to effectively staff, dispatch, and develop the *right* internal workforce is paramount to successfully transitioning services and delivering them profitably. Poor allocation or skill gaps directly undermine the profitability and quality of self-performed work, forcing continued reliance on external vendors or leading to inefficient internal operations. It directly addresses "ways to optimize staffing" in the context of self-delivery.

**3. Lack of Real-time Performance Visibility and Quantifiable Value Demonstration**
*   **Why it's #3:** This problem is about **proving and sustaining the value** of self-performance. While identifying and executing self-performance (Problems #1 and #2) generates value, if that value cannot be clearly measured, quantified, and communicated, it becomes difficult to justify continued investment, expand initiatives, or demonstrate ROI to clients. This is crucial for long-term account retention and growth, as well as internal accountability and continuous improvement for self-delivery.

---

**4. Inaccurate Demand Forecasting & Suboptimal Capacity Planning**
*   **Why it's #4:** This is a **foundational staffing problem** that impacts *all* FM operations, including self-performance. While not specific to *identifying* self-perform opportunities, accurate forecasting is essential for efficiently and profitably staffing *any* service, whether self-performed or not. If you can't predict demand, you'll either overspend on idle staff or underspend and incur high costs from overtime/external contractors. It significantly impacts the overall cost structure and efficiency, which directly affects the attractiveness and profitability of self-performance.

**5. Suboptimal Skill Utilization & Inefficient Work Assignment**
*   **Why it's #5:** This is another **general operational efficiency problem** for staffing. Once staff are hired and available (addressed by #4), how effectively are they utilized on a day-to-day basis? Inefficient work assignment leads to wasted time (travel, rework), lower productivity, and increased operational costs. While not unique to self-performance, solving this problem makes *any* internal staffing more cost-effective and competitive against external vendors, thereby supporting the overall self-delivery strategy.

**6. Lack of Granular Performance Visibility & Productivity Bottlenecks**
*   **Why it's #6:** This problem is about **continuous operational improvement** for all FM staffing. While Problem #3 focuses specifically on quantifying the *value of self-performance*, this problem is broader, focusing on understanding *why* any staffing operation (self-perform or otherwise) is or isn't efficient. It provides the granular data needed to identify and rectify inefficiencies in general, which will naturally benefit self-performance operations as well. It's more about refinement after initial implementation.

**7. High Employee Turnover & Inadequate Talent Development**
*   **Why it's #7 (Least Valuable in this specific context):** While critically important for any large service organization, this is more of an **underlying HR/workforce sustainability problem** than a direct driver of *finding* or *optimizing* self-performance opportunities. High turnover creates a constant drain on resources and institutional knowledge, making it harder to maintain a stable, skilled workforce for *any* operation, including self-performance. However, the solutions to the higher-ranked problems (especially #2) will often *contribute* to better talent development and retention. It's a foundational issue, but not the most immediate or direct bottleneck to initiating and proving the value of self-performance.


Here's a comprehensive table outlining all the business problems and their corresponding solutions, ranked by business value and including a complexity assessment for each solution.

**Complexity Scale:**
*   **Low:** Straightforward data, off-the-shelf tools, minimal integration.
*   **Medium:** Requires data integration, standard ML models, moderate change management.
*   **High:** Complex data integration, advanced ML/optimization, real-time components, significant organizational impact.
*   **Very High:** Cutting-edge AI/ML, large-scale real-time integration, significant cultural and process transformation.
