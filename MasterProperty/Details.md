Requirements for the Property Mastering Effort
Upstream Data Integration: Use "my data" IDs across all relevant systems, with resources allocated to insert these IDs and accounts required to review them. This is a policy-driven approach to standardize property data. 1:03
Downstream Match and Merge: Implement an LLM-based process to join and clean data by address, creating a common ID for properties when upstream mastering is incomplete. 1:38
Standardization: Ensure data is standardized, either by upstream mastering or downstream cleaning, to enable reliable analytics and reporting. 2:18
Human Review: Require account holders to review the integrated data for accuracy, even when the process is automated on their behalf. 1:19
Parallel Approaches: Run both upstream (policy/mastering) and downstream (LLM match/merge) efforts simultaneously to address gaps and ensure completeness. 1:54
