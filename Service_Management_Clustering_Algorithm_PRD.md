## Business Problem Statement

### Primary Business Challenge
CBRE currently lacks a systematic, data-driven approach to **capacity planning for accounts and portfolios**, resulting in suboptimal staffing configurations that impact service delivery and profitability. This manifests in several critical areas:

- **Inaccurate Capacity Planning**: No systematic method to determine optimal staffing levels for specific accounts or portfolios
- **Inefficient Resource Deployment**: Technicians allocated without consideration of geographic efficiency and workload distribution
- **Poor Staffing Configuration Visibility**: Limited understanding of optimal skill mix and technician allocation for given service requirements
- **Missed Optimization Opportunities**: Inability to identify capacity gaps, excesses, and self-performance expansion potential
- **Account-Specific Planning Gaps**: No framework to assess staffing requirements for new account acquisitions or portfolio changes

### Business Impact
- **Suboptimal Account Profitability**: Incorrect staffing leading to cost overruns and reduced margins
- **Poor Service Delivery**: Inadequate capacity planning resulting in SLA violations and client dissatisfaction
- **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: 25% of technician time spent on non-productive activities due to poor planning
- **Missed Revenue Opportunities**: $2M+ in potential self-performance opportunities remain unidentified
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Inability to accurately bid on new accounts due to poor capacity planning capabilities

### Root Causes
1. **Lack of Systematic Capacity Planning**: No data-driven methodology to determine optimal staffing for accounts
2. **Manual Resource Planning**: Staffing decisions based on intuition rather than analytical insights
3. **Poor Geographic Intelligence**: No consideration of travel efficiency and service density in staffing decisions
4. **Fragmented Account Analysis**: No unified approach to assess capacity requirements across different account types
5. **Limited Self-Performance Visibility**: No systematic identification of opportunities to transition vendor work to CBRE staff

## Conclusion

The Service Management Clustering Algorithm represents a foundational capacity planning solution that enables CBRE to systematically determine optimal staffing configurations for any account or portfolio. By first establishing the ideal combination of technician skills, geographic distribution, and capacity allocation, this algorithm provides the critical infrastructure needed for accurate capacity planning and cost optimization.

Once optimal staffing configurations are established, the algorithm's secondary capability identifies self-performance opportunities where additional capacity or strategic repositioning can capture vendor work transitions. This two-phase approach ensures that capacity planning excellence serves as the foundation for strategic business growth.

The comprehensive framework outlined in this PRD ensures successful implementation through clear prerequisites, detailed technical specifications, robust risk mitigation strategies, and defined success criteria. With projected improvements in capacity planning accuracy, operational efficiency, and the identification of $2M+ in self-performance opportunities, this algorithm forms the cornerstone of CBRE's data-driven approach to workforce optimization.

**Primary Value**: Accurate capacity planning for accounts and portfolios through systematic analysis of optimal staffing combinations, geographic clustering, and workload distribution.

**Secondary Value**: Strategic identification of self-performance opportunities that leverage optimized capacity to capture additional revenue and reduce vendor dependency.

Success depends on careful attention to data quality, stakeholder engagement, and phased implementation to minimize risk while maximizing value realization. The monitoring and optimization framework ensures continuous improvement in capacity planning accuracy and adaptation to changing business requirements, supporting CBRE's long-term strategic objectives and competitive market position.
