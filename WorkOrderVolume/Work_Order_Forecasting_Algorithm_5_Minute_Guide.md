# Work Order Forecasting Algorithm - 5-Minute Guide

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Document Type**: Quick Reference Guide

## What is Work Order Forecasting?

**Simple Definition**: An AI system that predicts how many maintenance requests each building will generate 3+ months in advance, so you can plan staffing, budgets, and resources before demand hits.

**Why This Matters**: Instead of scrambling to react when work orders flood in, you know in January that March will be busy with HVAC calls, allowing you to hire, train, and position resources proactively.

## The Problem We're Solving

### ‚ùå **Current State (Without Forecasting)**

**Scenario**: Spring arrives with unexpected HVAC surge
‚Üì
**Manager's Reaction**: "Why are we getting 300% more HVAC calls? We're completely overwhelmed!"
‚Üì
**What Happens**: Emergency hiring ‚Üí Overtime costs ‚Üí Missed deadlines ‚Üí Unhappy clients
‚Üì
**Result**: Budget blown, team stressed, service quality compromised

### ‚úÖ **Future State (With Forecasting)**

**Scenario**: January forecast shows spring HVAC surge coming
‚Üì
**AI Prediction**: "March will see 250% increase in HVAC work orders across portfolio"
‚Üì
**Proactive Response**: Hire seasonal HVAC techs in February ‚Üí Pre-position equipment
‚Üì
**Outcome**: Smooth operations, budget on target, excellent service delivery
