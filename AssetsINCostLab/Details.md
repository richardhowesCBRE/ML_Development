Field Extraction: Use LLMs to extract relevant fields (e.g., building system, asset name) from asset data for mapping. 3:29
Mapping to Cost Lab: Match extracted asset data to the Cost Lab list to obtain unique information such as estimated replacement cost, average service life, and probability of failure. 3:46
Accuracy Assessment: Generate a probability of accuracy for each mapping to ensure reliability. 3:54
Data Utilization: Enable downstream processes to leverage Cost Lab data for analytics, such as identifying assets at risk and calculating potential savings from replacements. 4:47
Benchmarking and Integration: Integrate Cost Lab mapping into existing workflows to avoid redundant machine learning models and maximize the value of available data. 5:16
