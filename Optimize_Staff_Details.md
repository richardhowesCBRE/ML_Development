Optimal Staffing Breakdown

Model 1 - Classify WO

Model 2 - Classify Assignee

Model 3 - recommend Dispatch optimizations

Model 4 - recommend staffing changes



There are several decisions that can be made



Optimize existing configurations

change the call out order for a given location + Service

swap CBRE for Vendor or vice versa for a given service + location

update the NTE for a given location + service





Staff Changes

Increase staffing for a given service type, location, city, region

decrease staffing for a given service type, location, city, region

Leverage the on-demand tech program instead of dedicated on Account resources





In order to do this we need to understand how both service and assignees are performing. We can start with a few basic metrics:



Workorder

Complexity - high, medium, low

cost - high, medium, low

location - city, rural, remote

Service type - based on IFM Service Classification

asset type - based on Uniformat L3

Outcome Classification - one or more of the 10 outcomes

Service line classification - one or more of the servicelines



Assignee

Experience level - low, medium, high

Trade designation - electrician, plumber, roofer, laborer ectâ€¦

Location - where they reside, what primary locations they serve

tenure with CBRE - in years

role designation - worker, supervisor, vendor
