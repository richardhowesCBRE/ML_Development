# Comprehensive Plan for Optimal Staffing Solutions
## Transforming CBRE Facilities Management Through Data-Driven Workforce Optimization

---

## Executive Summary

CBRE's Facilities Management division faces critical challenges in optimizing staffing and service delivery that directly impact client satisfaction, operational costs, and competitive positioning. Current gaps in self-performance opportunity identification, workforce allocation inefficiencies, and lack of real-time performance visibility are preventing the organization from capturing an estimated **15-25% cost reduction potential** and achieving optimal service delivery standards.

This comprehensive plan outlines a data-driven transformation approach leveraging advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI to solve the critical business challenge of **moving work from vendors to CBRE self-performance**. Focusing on two core business problems that directly enable vendor-to-CBRE transitions, the solution framework will deliver measurable improvements including:

- **60% increase in self-performance opportunity identification** through AI-powered vendor analysis
- **40% faster vendor-to-CBRE transition execution** via data-driven opportunity scoring
- **25-30% cost reduction** from strategic vendor work transitions to self-performance
- **35% improvement in newly self-performed work quality** through performance optimization

The implementation follows a three-phase approach over 18 months, prioritizing **vendor-to-CBRE transition enablement** first to establish quick wins and build momentum for comprehensive self-performance expansion. Expected ROI is **3:1 within 24 months** with accelerated value realization as more vendor work transitions to profitable CBRE self-delivery.

## Core Business Problems for Vendor-to-CBRE Transitions

### Problem Summary Matrix

| Rank | Problem | Problem Statement | Vendor-to-CBRE Impact | Complexity |
|------|---------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **1** | **Suboptimal Identification and Prioritization of Self-Performance Opportunities** | CBRE lacks a comprehensive, data-driven system to identify, evaluate, and prioritize vendor work that should transition to self-performance, leading to missed cost savings and continued reliance on expensive external vendors. | **Critical** - Enables identification of $2M+ annual transition opportunities, 40% vendor dependency reduction | **High** |
| **6** | **Lack of Granular Performance Visibility & Productivity Bottlenecks** | Limited granular performance insights prevent optimization of newly self-performed work, risking failed transitions and client satisfaction issues. | **Essential** - Ensures successful execution of vendor-to-CBRE transitions, 25% rework reduction, 90% transition success rate | **Medium** |

### Primary Focus: Moving Work from Vendors to CBRE

This plan specifically targets the **two critical problems** that directly enable successful vendor-to-CBRE work transitions:

1. **Problem 1** - The ability to systematically identify and prioritize which vendor-performed work should transition to CBRE self-performance
2. **Problem 6** - The capability to ensure newly self-performed work is executed efficiently and meets quality standards

All other operational optimization problems, while valuable, are secondary to this core vendor-to-CBRE transition mission.

### Detailed Problem Statements

#### Problem 1: Suboptimal Identification and Prioritization of Self-Performance Opportunities
**Business Value Rank**: 1 (Critical for Vendor-to-CBRE Transitions)  
**Root Cause**: CBRE currently lacks a comprehensive, dynamic, and data-driven system to consistently identify, evaluate, and prioritize vendor-performed work that should transition to lucrative self-performance across diverse client portfolios and service scopes.

**Specific Challenges**:
- No systematic method to evaluate which vendor services should transition to self-performance
- Missing cost-benefit analysis framework for vendor-to-CBRE transition decisions
- Lack of market benchmarking to identify vendor overpricing and self-performance opportunities
- Inability to assess internal capability readiness for taking on vendor work
- Limited visibility into vendor performance gaps that create transition opportunities

**Business Impact**: This leads to missed vendor-to-CBRE transition opportunities worth millions annually, inefficient allocation of internal resources, and continued reliance on higher-cost third-party vendors for work that could be self-delivered more profitably, thereby reducing account margins and competitive positioning.

**Vendor-to-CBRE Focus**: This problem is the **primary barrier** to systematic vendor work transitions. Solving it enables CBRE to identify $2M+ in annual transition opportunities and reduce vendor dependency by 40%.

---

#### Problem 6: Lack of Granular Performance Visibility & Productivity Bottlenecks
**Business Value Rank**: 6 (Essential for Transition Success)  
**Root Cause**: CBRE lacks real-time, granular visibility into individual and team performance, making it impossible to optimize newly self-performed work and ensure successful vendor-to-CBRE transitions.

**Specific Challenges**:
- Limited visibility into individual technician productivity and quality metrics for newly self-performed work
- Inability to identify performance bottlenecks in vendor-to-CBRE transition processes
- Lack of real-time performance monitoring for transition risk management
- Missing benchmarking capabilities to ensure self-performed work exceeds vendor standards
- No systematic approach to optimize newly transitioned work processes

**Business Impact**: Without performance optimization, vendor-to-CBRE transitions risk failure, potentially leading to client dissatisfaction, contract losses, and reverting work back to more expensive vendors.

**Vendor-to-CBRE Focus**: This problem is **critical for execution success** of vendor-to-CBRE transitions. Solving it ensures 90% transition success rate and 25% improvement in newly self-performed work quality.
