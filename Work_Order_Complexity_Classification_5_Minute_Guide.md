## What is Work Order Complexity Classification?

**Simple Definition**: An AI system that instantly reads a work order and tells you exactly what skill level technician you need (apprentice, generalist, or specialist) before anyone starts working.

**Why This Matters**: Instead of guessing or learning through trial and error, you know upfront if a job needs your best specialist or can be handled by an apprentice.

|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Technical Knowledge** | Basic skills | Some expertise | Advanced specialization |
| **Tools Required** | Standard tools | Diagnostic equipment | Specialized instruments |
| **Safety Requirements** | Minimal | Standard protocols | Extensive safety measures |
| **Time to Complete** | < 2 hours | 2-6 hours | 6+ hours |
| **Business Impact** | Minimal disruption | Moderate planning | Critical coordination |
| **Failure Risk** | Low cost of error | Moderate impact | High consequences |

### Data Patterns That Indicate Complexity

**Historical Data ‚Üí Complexity Indicators:**

- **High Labor Hours**: Jobs that consistently take longer than average
